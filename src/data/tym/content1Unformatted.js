It had a long strap, and she carried it slung across her shoulder. It was about eleven o&#x2019;clock at night, dark, and she was walking alone, when a boy ran up behind her and tried to snatch her purse. The strap broke with the single tug the boy gave it from behind. But the boy&#x2019;s weight and the weight of the purse combined caused him to lose his balance. Instead of taking off full blast as he had hoped, the boy fell on his back on the sidewalk and his legs flew up. The large woman simply turned around and kicked him right square in his blue-jeaned sitter. Then she reached down, picked the boy up by his shirt front, and shook him until his teeth rattled.</p><p id="p6" class="s10 s13"><a epub:type="noteref" href="#viewport-popup-0-aside"><img class="s3 s4" width="92" height="92" src="assets/images/Flipgrid.png" id="image-6" alt="USE READING STRATEGIES Visualize  Picture the scene where the boy attempts to steal the purse.
